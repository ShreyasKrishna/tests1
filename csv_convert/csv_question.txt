Write a script to convert a text file containing measurement data
to a CSV file.

The input file will be of the form:

    #comment
    MEASURE:
        POINT:
            X: <float or int>
            Y: <float or int>
            Z: <float or int>
            RES: <float or int>
        POINT:
            ...

The file can contain any number of "POINT" blocks, but only one "MEASURE" 
block. Only include results after the "MEASURE" block starts. Comments
can appear at the end of lines or on separate lines.

Some of the data may not be clean, so the order and case of the input items 
(X, Y, Z, RES) is not guaranteed.

The script should convert the input file to a CSV with the following format:

X, Y, Z, RES
<point x>, <point y>,<point z>,<point res>
...

e.g.

#This is a test report for xxx
MEASURE:
    POINT:
        X: 30
        Y: 40
        Z: 50
        RES: 0.03
    POINT:
        X: 30
        Y: 42
        Z: 50
        RES: -0.1

to

X,Y,Z,RES
30,40,50,0.03
30,42,50,-0.1

There are two sample input files in this folder. The code should be able to
successfully convert both files.
